# &#10023; Erin's Book Tracker &#10023;

This is my first project using JavaScript. I have created a simple book tracker that allows you to add books that you have read and delete them. Even though it was a more simple project, I learned so much about JavaScript and using persistant local storage to save data across sessions to ensure that a users' information is retained after closing the browser.

### Technology Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Terminal, Git, Local Storage

I also used [Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/en/) to create my own handwritten font.

### Challenges:
1. Dynamically adding rows to a table when a user adds a book.
2. Adding a summary row and updating that row everytime a book was added or deleted.
3. Centering the summary row across the 5 columns was tricky at first, but I finally figured it out after inspecting my code with the Chrome Developer Tools. I realized I had 4 extra cells that were entered in the Summary Row causing the entire table to shift to the left and not be centered in its container.


### Features I want to add:
1. Add ratings next for each book that is added.
2. Implement the book inventory by using a MySQL or SQLite database.
3. Then add features such as sorting and filtering.
